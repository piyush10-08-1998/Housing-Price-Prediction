# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction

This is a beginner-friendly machine learning project that predicts housing prices using various features of a house (e.g., size, bedrooms etc). 
The project includes data cleaning, feature encoding, model training, and evaluation.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains housing features such as:
- Area
- Location on main road
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Furnishing status 
- etc
> ✅ *All categorical data is label-encoded for model training.*

---

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy (for data manipulation)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for ML modeling and evaluation)
- Jupyter Notebook (for development)

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Checked for missing values
- Visualized price distribution
- Generated a correlation heatmap to find the most relevant features

---

## 🧠 Model

- **Linear Regression** was used to predict housing prices.
- Evaluated using:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R² Score

---

## 📈 Results
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 970043.40 Mean Squared Error (MSE): 1754318687330.66 R² Score: 0.65

## 
> 🔍 Not optimized — this is a baseline model. Future improvements can include feature engineering, outlier handling, and advanced models like Random Forest or XGBoost.
